# Insurance-Payments-Predictions
In this project we need to predict customers' medical insurance payments based on their persoanl data (age, sex, place of living, etc.) I use two ML models to tackle this problem: KNN and RF.
Steps undertaken with KNN model:
* Label Encoding
* Scale Standartisation
* Hyperparameter tuning (simple search)
* Cross Validation

Steps undertaken with Random Forest model:
* Label Encoding
* Hyperparameter tuning through Bayes Optimization
* Cross Validation
