# Insurance-Payments-Predictions
In this project we need to predict customers' medical insurance payments based on their persoanl data (age, sex, place of living, etc.) I used two ML models to tackle this problem: KNN and RF.

Steps undertaken with KNN model:
* Label Encoding
* Scale Standartisation
* Hyperparameter tuning (simple search)
* Cross Validation

Steps undertaken with Random Forest model:
* Label Encoding
* Hyperparameter tuning through Bayes Optimization
* Cross Validation

Conclusion: Results obtained from Random Forest are rather worthwile, while KNN didn't demonstrate equally impressive perfomance.
